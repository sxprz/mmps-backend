    "## One possible solution:\n",
    "This example highlights the importance of understanding the limitations of transformer models when dealing with long texts. Simply throwing a long text at a transformer model without considering its token length limit will likely result in failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section of this notebook, we'll explore strategies for effectively handling long texts in transformer models for QA tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Handling Long Texts with Transformers: A Practical Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we saw how naively applying a transformer model to a long text can lead to errors. But don't worry! We've developed a set of Python functions as possible solution for handling long texts in transformer models for QA tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the approach we've outlined below is a practical solution for handling long texts with transformer models, it's by no means the only or the best solution. There are several ways you could improve upon our code or implement your own solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, you could experiment with different chunk sizes and overlaps to see if they yield better results. You could also try different ways of ranking the answers, such as using different similarity measures or incorporating additional information into the ranking process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, there are many existing repositories on the internet that provide solutions for handling long texts with transformer models. These repositories often include more advanced techniques and optimizations, and can be a great resource for improving your own implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the key to success in machine learning is experimentation and continuous learning. Don't be afraid to try new things and learn from others. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Splitting Text into Chunks\n",
    "To overcome the token length limit of transformer models, we split the long text into smaller chunks (see \"split_context\" below). Each chunk is of a specific size that the model can handle, and the chunks overlap a bit to ensure we don't miss any information that could be at the boundaries of the chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Asking Questions on Each Chunk\n",
    "We then feed each chunk to the model and collect the answers (see \"answer_question\" below). This ensures that the model considers the question in the context of each chunk of the long text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ranking the Answers\n",
    "Once we have the answers, we need a way to determine which one is the best (see \"find_best_answer\" below). For this, we use the concept of vectorizing the answers and the question (see \"vectorize_text\" below), and then calculating the cosine similarity between them (see \"calculate_similarity\" below). The answer with the highest cosine similarity to the question is considered the best answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows us to leverage the power of transformer models for QA tasks on long texts, without running into memory issues or the need for complex fine-tuning. It's a practical and effective solution for tasks like log file analysis, where the texts can be very long.\n",

The Nazi seizure of power in 1933 led to the establishment of a totalitarian dictatorship, World War II, and the Holocaust. After the end of World War II in Europe and a period of Allied occupation, in 1949, Germany as a whole was organized into two separate polities with limited sovereignty: the Federal Republic of Germany, generally known as West Germany, and the German Democratic Republic, known as East Germany, while Berlin continued its de jure Four Power status. The Federal Republic of Germany was a founding member of the European Economic Community and the European Union, while the German Democratic Republic was a communist Eastern Bloc state and member of the Warsaw Pact.

    "## Using Vectorization for Text Summarization\n",
    "Vectorization is not only useful for ranking answers in a QA task, but also for summarizing large texts like log files. \n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a summary or a shorter version of a log file is a practical and efficient approach for several reasons. Firstly, asking questions to a full log can be time-consuming due to the large amount of data that needs to be processed (see code cell below which can take multiple minutes for a longer log file! Execute the code above to have all libraries loaded). This can lead to slower response times and a less efficient system overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, asking questions to a compact summary is much faster. The system only needs to process a smaller amount of data, which can significantly improve response times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, a summarized version of a log file is more user-friendly. Users can quickly get an overview of the information without having to sift through large amounts of data. This makes it easier for users to find the information they need and improves the overall user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, summarizing log files can lead to a more efficient and user-friendly system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple approach to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chunking: As before, split the log file into smaller chunks that the transformer model can handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vectorization: Convert each chunk into a vector. This will give you a set of vectors that represent the content of your log file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clustering: Use a clustering algorithm like K-means to group the vectors. Each cluster will represent a 'topic' in your log file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Summarization: For each cluster, choose the chunk whose vector is closest to the centroid of the cluster as the 'summary' of that topic. You could also consider using a transformer model trained for summarization to further condense these representative chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach will give you a summary of the main topics in your log file, which can be very useful for understanding the overall content and identifying any issues or important events. However, keep in mind that this is a very basic approach and there are many more advanced techniques for text summarization out there.\n"
